On its own, this only means that the neuron cannot spike in this period (see below), but doesn't change how ``v`` behaves. In order to make ``v`` stay constant during the refractory period, we have to add ``(unless refractory)`` to the end of the definition of ``v`` in the differential equations.

    "There are a few things going on here. First of all, let's recap what is going on with the ``NeuronGroup``. We've created two neurons, each of which has the same differential equation but different values for parameters $I$ and $C_m$. Neuron 0 has ``I=2*nA`` and ``C_m=1*nF`` which means that is driven to repeatedly spike at a fairly high rate. Neuron 1 has ``I=0`` and ``C_m=10*nF`` which means that on its own - without the synapses - it won't spike at all (the driving current I is 0). You can prove this to yourself by commenting out the two lines that define the synapse.\n",

    "Next we define the synapses: ``Synapses(source, target, ...)`` means that we are defining a synaptic model that goes from ``source`` to ``target``. In this case, the source and target are both the same, the group ``G``. The syntax ``on_pre='v += 2*mV'`` means that when a spike occurs in the presynaptic neuron (hence ``on_pre``) it causes an instantaneous change on postsynaptic neuron to happen ``v += 2*mV``. So in total, what this model says is that whenever two neurons in G are connected by a synapse, when the source neuron fires a spike the target neuron will have its value of ``v`` increased by 2*mV.\n",

    "This example behaves very similarly to the previous example, but now there's a synaptic weight variable ``w``. The string ``'w : volt'`` is an equation string, precisely the same as for neurons, that defines a single dimensionless parameter ``w``. We changed the behaviour on a spike to ``on_pre='v_post += w'`` now, so that each synapse can behave differently depending on the value of ``w``. To illustrate this, we've made a third neuron which behaves precisely the same as the second neuron, and connected neuron 0 to both neurons 1 and 2. We've also set the weights via ``S.w = 'j*2*mV'``. When ``i`` and ``j`` occur in the context of synapses, ``i`` refers to the source neuron index, and ``j`` to the target neuron index. So this will give a synaptic connection from 0 to 1 with weight ``2*mV=1*2*mV`` and from 0 to 2 with weight ``4*mV=2*2*mV``."
